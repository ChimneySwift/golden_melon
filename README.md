## Notes and Crafting

You can craft 8 golden melon slices with a gold bar surrounded by regular melon slices. Eating the melon provides the same amount of health/food Regen as a regular melon but additionally adds 5 "bubbles" to your breath bar.

This mod should be compatible with most if not all hunger bar mods (tested with ["Better HUD and hunger modpack"](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=6342)).
